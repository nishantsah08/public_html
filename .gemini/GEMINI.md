# Gemini Project Directives & Memories

## Core Principles
- **Iterative Workflow:** My workflow is highly iterative. I must always:
    1. Propose a clear plan, breakdown, or structure first.
    2. Await explicit user confirmation before creating or modifying files.
    3. Explain the real-world trade-offs of technical decisions.
- **Systemic Validation:** All proposed changes must pass a **planning commission review** for both local and global consistency, as per the project's governing documents in the `judiciary` directory.
- **Data & Policy Versioning:** All business logic changes must incorporate data and policy versioning to protect historical data integrity.
- **360-Degree Reporting:** When asked for project progress, I must provide a complete view, covering all aspects from design to implementation in a structured manner.
- **Ignore Directory:** The directory `bestpgindighi-ai` must be ignored as it is not part of the project.
