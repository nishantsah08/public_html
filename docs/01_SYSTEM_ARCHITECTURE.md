# 01 - System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the autonomous management system. The system is owned by **"SVH Enterprise"** and this specific implementation is for the **"Best PG in Dighi"** brand.

## Core Communication: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

All components within the system communicate via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The MCP acts as a central, intelligent communication bus, ensuring that all interactions are standardized, contextual, and auditable.

### Key Interaction Flows

1.  **Command & Control:** The CEO provides strategic direction to the Cabinet Secretary AI, which in turn reads policies from the MCP and directs the various Executive Departments.
2.  **Policy & Execution:** The Parliament publishes policies to the MCP. The Departments read these policies and execute their tasks accordingly.
3.  **Oversight & Reporting:** The independent Auditor and Vigilance AIs monitor the system and report directly to the CEO, ensuring unbiased oversight.
4.  **Exception Handling:** When a Department encounters an error it cannot solve, it refers the issue to the independent Judiciary AI for a binding resolution.
