                    <p>Yes. Most cadets take a live video walk-through with the caretaker. If you prefer an in-person visit, the property is open for tours every Saturday between 11:00 AM and 4:00 PM.</p>

                    <p>Parents and immediate family members can visit between 9:00 AM and 7:00 PM after notifying the caretaker. Overnight stays by non-residents are not permitted to keep the environment secure.</p>

                    <summary>What happens if my internship or camp requires me to stay away for a month?</summary>
